                           **************************
                           Contribute code to dmedia!
                           **************************

Testing
=======

The dmedia tests are run through `setup.py` like this:

    ./setup.py test

This will run the unit-tests and doc-tests.  dmedia is very focused on rapid,
test-drive development.  If you contribute a feature to dmedia, it must include
comprehensive unit/doc tests for the feature.  This is a good thing.  :)

As you work on a feature, you will likely want to run only tests for modules
related to your change.  You can filter tests with the --names option, like
this:

    ./setup.py test --names=filestore,util

That would run all unit-tests and doc-tests in:

    dmedia/filestore.py
    dmedia/util.py
    dmedia/tests/test_filestore.py
    dmedia/tests/test_util.py

You can skip the doc-tests (and run only the unit-tests) like this:

    ./setup.py test --no-doctest

Or skip the unit-tests (and run only the doc-tests) like this:

    ./setup.py test --no-unittest


Coding Style
============

Contributions must follow good PEP-8, PEP-257 style:

    http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/

    http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/


Workflow
========

Work on dmedia is coordinated through its Launchpad project:

    https://launchpad.net/dmedia

To get a feel for the codebase, consider starting with a small feature bug
tagged with "bitesize", which you can search for here:

    https://bugs.launchpad.net/dmedia/+bugs?field.tag=bitesize

Once you begin work on a bug, change the "Assigned To" field to youself so that
others know it's being worked on.  The bzr workflow will go something this:

    bzr branch lp:dmedia cool-feature
    cd cool-feature
    # Do stuff...
    bzr commit -m "Added basic cool-feature and tests"
    # Do more stuff...
    bzr commit -m "Added docstrings"
    bzr push lp:~username/dmedia/cool-feature

You should now see your branch in the list of un-merged dmedia branches:

    https://code.launchpad.net/dmedia

Visit that page and propose a merge into lp:dmedia (the trunk, always the focus
of active development).  Tests will be automatically run using Tarmac, and if
they pass, your merge will be reviewed (by Jason most likely).  Your merge might
be accepted as is, or you might be asked to make some further improvements
first.

If you need help, ping jderose on the #novacut IRC channel.
